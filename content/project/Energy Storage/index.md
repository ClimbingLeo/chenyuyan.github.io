With the development of the human society and increasing demands for the power supply, sustainable resources are promising to be the supplicant for the fossil fuel. Due to the imbalance geological distribution of sustainable resources in china, high voltage direct current transmission can primarily reduce the transmission loss and enhances the stability of the power supply. Therefore, high energy density and electrical strength are two key factors for the power capacitor. Generally, Energy density of the dielectric material obeys 

$$
U = \frac{1}{2}{\varepsilon _0}\varepsilon {E^2}
$$
This project was funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of the PeopleÂ´s Republic of China. We used the nano doping to promote the energy storage and electrical strength efficiency of the power capacitor. Nanofller can formulate an interfacial region between the neat material matrix phase and the nanofiller phase. Interfacial region can affect the dielectric property through modulate the electron transport and molecular movement in the amorphous region.  Our research aims at proposing a universal method for enhancing the dielectric constant and storage density of the polypropylene film, further promoting the energy density of the power capacitor. The research focus lies in the electrical property induced by the interfacial regions.
