Flashover and electrical breakdown are two main deterioration forms of the power equipment. A series of dynamic changes play an important role in these deterioration processes. It is essential to investigate the phenomenon and its mechanism of the changes that predate the flashover and breakdown. In this way, we can propose some methods to promote corresponding properties.

This project investigated the coupling impact of space charge accumulation, transient arc nanoparticle bombardment, metal particle deposition on the flashover property of fracture insulating system in the process of dc arc switching, and revealed its influence regularity and failure mechanism. The study figured out the methods to suppress the space charge accumulation and metal particle deposition in the fracture insulating system and proposed approaches to resist flashover damage and aging based on nanocomposite modification tech. This research provided the theoretical and technological support for enhancing the circuit breaker's voltage, current, and lifespan. I was mainly involved in modeling energy accumulation and flashover processes and investigated the influence of charge transport parameters and temperature on flashover behavior.
