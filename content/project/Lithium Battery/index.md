Lithium batteries are characterized by high specific energy, high efficiency and long lifespan. These unique properties have made lithium batteries the power sources of choice for the consumer electronics market with a production of the order of billions of units per year. These batteries are also expected to find a prominent role as ideal electrochemical storage systems in renewable energy plants, as well as power systems for sustainable vehicles, such as hybrid and electric vehicles. However, scaling up the lithium battery technology for these applications is still problematic since issues such as safety, costs, wide operational temperature and materials availability, are still to be resolved. This project addressed the efficiency promotion and storage enhancement of lithium batteries.

On the one hand, the project focused on the design of sensor structure based on ARM to promote charging efficiency and promotion. On the other hand,  the project investigated the impact of different electrode material on the charging efficiency and storage performance on the lithium battery. In addition, visualization of charge distribution was also given, based on the charge transport modeling, to explain the electrical property enhancement.
