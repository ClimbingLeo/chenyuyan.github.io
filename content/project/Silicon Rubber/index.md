In the actual power system, the power equipment needs to withstand the high-order harmonics and high temperature. Its performance will be gradually declined in this scenario. The dielectric property of the insulating material is the critical factor for evaluating the performance of the equipment.

The study, taking the silicon rubber from the outer coat of cable terminals and the insulating oil paper in the bush as the research objects, quantitatively manifested the aging status and summarized the insulating material deterioration regularity. It delves into the changes in the trap distribution within the system due to changes in the cross-linking properties of the silicone rubber molecular chains as the temperature changes. Then the trap property changes further lead to the changes in carrier transport properties and macroscopic electrical property. This project proposed a mathematical model to predict the lifespans of cable and bush.
