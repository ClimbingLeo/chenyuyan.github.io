abstract: "Polypropylene (PP), with high breakdown strength, low dissipation and good processibility, is one of the most widely used dielectric material for power equipment, especially in power capacitors and power cables. The improvement of PP-based dielectric material can benefit the properties enhancement of power capacitors and cables, and thus to meet with the rapid development of the power system. Nanocomposite provided a promising orientation to reach the target and recent research approaches of PP nanocomposite for power equipment were reviewed in this paper. In this paper, we linked the nanofillers to the improved properties of PP nanocomposite, and categorized the research works into nanoclay/PP composites, metal oxide/PP nanocomposite, conductive particles/PP nanocomposite, and PP coreâ€“shell nanocomposites chronologically, corresponding to the enhanced thermal and mechanical property, breakdown strength property and energy storage property, respectively. Based on the achieved approaches, prospective for future research was proposed, providing a worth-considering direction for the future work. "
