abstract: "Polyimide has excellent electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties and is widely used as a dielectric material in electrical equipment and electronic devices. However, the influencing mechanism of sample thickness on electrical breakdown of polyimide has not been very clear until now. The direct current (DC) electrical breakdown properties of polyimide as a function of thickness were investigated by experiments and simulations of space charge modulated electrical breakdown (SCEB) model and charge transport and molecular displacement modulated (CTMD) model. The experimental results show that the electrical breakdown field decreases with an increase in the sample thickness in the form of an inverse power function, and the inverse power index is 0.324. Trap properties and carrier mobility were also measured for the simulations. Both the simulation results obtained by the SCEB model and the CTMD model have the inverse power forms of breakdown field as a function of thickness with the power indexes of 0.030 and 0.339. The outputs of the CTMD model were closer to the experiments. This indicates that the displacement of a molecular chain with occupied deep traps enlarging the free volume might be a main factor causing the DC electrical breakdown field of polyimide varying with sample thickness."
