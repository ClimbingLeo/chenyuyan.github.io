abstract: "A method is proposed to calculate the density of deep traps formed in interaction zones based on mesoscopic structure and double electric layer of polymer nanocomposites. Then a space charge modulated breakdown model is utilized to investigate electrical breakdown property and its relation with deep traps in interaction zones. It is found that deep traps formed around independent interaction zones suppress the accumulation of space charges and the distortion of electric field, leading to the improvement of breakdown strength."
